![Result](./image/result.jpg)

This project demonstrates a visualization of image predictions using a trained model. The steps involved are:

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - A dataset of face images [here]("https://conradsanderson.id.au/lfwcrop/lfwcrop_color.zip") is used as the starting point.

2. **Adding Noise**:
   - Gaussian noise is added to the images to create noisy versions.

3. **Model Creation**:
   - An encoder-decoder fully convolutional network is created to denoise the images.
